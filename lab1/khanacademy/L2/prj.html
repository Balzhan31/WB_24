      <strong><em>Mount Fuji in Japan</em></strong>
    </h2>
    <p id="info">
        Mount Fuji, highest mountain in Japan. It rises to 12,388 feet (3,776 metres) near the Pacific Ocean 
        coast in Yamanashi and Shizuoka ken (prefectures) of central Honshu, about 60 miles (100 km) west of the Tokyo-Yokohama 
        metropolitan area. It is a volcano that has been dormant since its last eruption, in 1707, but is still generally 
        classified as active by geologists.

        The mountain is the major feature of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park (1936), 
        and it is at the centre of a UNESCO World Heritage site designated in 2013.

    <h3>Some interesting info...</h3>
    <ul class="extra">
      <li>
        Most Japanese would say that Mt Fuji belongs to everyone, but part of it – from 3,360m to the top – is private land. 
        From the 8th station and upwards, it is the private territory of Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha, which owns more than 1,300 temples 
        in the country. This is because in 1606, Tokugawa Ieyasu, the shogun of the Edo period, donated the area to the company.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mt Fuji became the first ski site in Japan in 1911, when Austrian soldiers, Major Theodore Edler von Lerch and Egon Edler 
        von Kratzer skied down from the 9th stage. Today, there is still a plaque on the 5th stage of Mt Fuji commemorating this event.
      </li>
      <li>
        Couples can get married at Okumiya Shrine located on Mt Fuji’s summit. Wedding services are offered by Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha 
        during mountain-climbing season in July and August. Due to the lack of space, however, wedding parties are limited to 10 people.
