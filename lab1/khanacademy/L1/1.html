    <h1> Five little flowers </h1>
        <p>
            Five little flowers growing in a row,<br />
            The first one said, “I’m purple you know!”<br />
            The second one said, “I’m pink as pink can be.”<br />
            The third one said, “I’m blue like the sea.”<br />
            The fourth one said, “I’m a very red fellow.”<br />
            And the fifth one said, “My color is yellow.”<br />
            Then out came the sun, big and bright.<br />
            And five little flowers smiled in delight.<br />
